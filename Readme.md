## Introduction
This project aims to develop an image captioning model that generates descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. The model leverages a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating captions.

## Features
- **Image Feature Extraction**: Utilizes pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16) to extract features from images.
- **Caption Generation**: Employs RNNs (LSTM) to generate captions based on extracted features.
- **Evaluation**: Implements BLEU score and other metrics to evaluate the quality of generated captions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple interface for users to input images and receive generated captions.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning.git
   cd image-captioning
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Mount Google Drive** (if using Google Colab):
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

2. **Load the Model**:
   ```python
   from keras.models import load_model
   model = load_model('path_to_your_model.h5')
   ```

3. **Generate Captions**:
   ```python
   caption = predict_caption(model, image_features)
   print(caption)
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is the Flickr30k dataset, which contains 30,000 images with multiple captions for each image. The dataset can be downloaded from [Flickr30k](http://shannon.cs.illinois.edu/DenotationGraph/).

## Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of:
- **CNN**: A pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction.
- **RNN**: An LSTM network for generating captions based on the extracted features.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **BLEU Score**: Measures the overlap between generated captions and reference captions.
- **METEOR**: Considers synonyms and stemming for a more nuanced evaluation.
- **CIDEr**: Focuses on the consensus between generated and reference captions.

## Results
- **BLEU-1 Score**: 0.535164
- **BLEU-2 Score**: 0.312153

The results indicate a reasonable level of accuracy in matching generated captions with reference captions.
